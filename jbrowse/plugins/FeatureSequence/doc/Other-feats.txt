## Other Subfeatures ##

Some sequence regions are not charactized by any subfeatures - these will be labeled as "Other". 
When automatic intron finding is used, introns which do not fall between two 'exon' or 'CDS' regions will not be identified.

It can be useful to manipulate these non-classified regions as a group. An informed user will hopefully know
enough about their sequence to determine if the sequences of type "Other" may be useful to them.
