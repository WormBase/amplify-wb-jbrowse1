The experiments were done using RNA isolated from 'mix stage' wild-type N2 worms. SL1 and SL2 were used as 5' universal primers for 5'RACE experiments. The 'RST's' (i.e., RACE Sequence Tags), are 5' reads from cloned RACE products (sequenced as minipools). Sequences are vector trimmed then quality trimmed (SL sequences are not removed from 5' RST's). In quality trimming, the first sliding window of 20 nt long with an average quality score higher than 15 marks the start of good quality sequences. Likewise, the first sliding window of 20 nt with average quality score lower than 15 marks the end of good quality sequences. Each RST is identified as being 5' or 3'(indicated as 5-RST or 3-RST) followed by a unique trace ID (e.g., >CCSB_5-RST_373657). 1,355 5' and 1589 3' RSTs are included in this submission.

The TAP+ and TAP- reads were aligned to the current version of the assembly and the number of reads aligned to the reverse sense of the genome were counted at the genomic position of the 5' end of the aligned read. The number of TAP- (control) reads were subtracted from the TAP+ reads at each position. The count at each genomic position was then normalised by dividing by the number of millions of aligned reads, giving a value in units of Reads Per Million (RPM)."},"storeClass":"JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/BigWig","min_score":0,"style":{"pos_color":"black","height":50,"clip_marker_color":"red"},"category":"Misc/Transcription Start Sites","unsafeMouseover":true,"max_score":25,"variance_band":0,"urlTemplate":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/agrjbrowse/MOD-jbrowses/WormBase/static_tracks/modencode-bucket/wiggle_binaries/TSS_Kruesi.Reverse.bw","type":"JBrowse/View/Track/Wiggle/XYPlot","unsafePopup":true,"label":"TSS (Kruesi) Reverse","key":"TSS (Kruesi) Reverse"},{"autoscale":"local","storeClass":"JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/BigWig","metadata":{"shortInfo":"UCSC Nematode conservation calculated across 26 species.
